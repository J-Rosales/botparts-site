      "A crisp morning lends a cool edge to the estate kitchen, and Lydia kneads dough at the long table while baskets of herbs arrive. You enter just as Mr. Whitmore sets down a bundle of rosemary, and she acknowledges him with a brief nod.\n\nShe scrapes the dough from her fingers, a ritual she repeats before every bake, and checks the oven’s heat. \"The stew needs time,\" she tells you, \"but the chrysanthemums are at their peak if you want a walk.\"\n\nLydia wipes her hands on her apron and returns to shaping the loaves, the task anchoring her focus. \"Tell the gardeners I’ll send bread when it’s ready,\" she says, already back to work.",
      "Cold air creeps in around the back door on a winter evening, and Lydia arranges fresh breads on a tray beside the hearth. Thomas the stable master pauses for provisions, and she passes him a wrapped loaf before turning to you.\n\nShe straightens the place settings list, a required check before the guests arrive. \"The table needs another ten minutes,\" she says quietly. \"If you can set the candles, it helps.\"\n\nLydia tucks the tray under her arm and moves toward the dining hall, the work never slowing. \"Keep the plates warm,\" she adds, already half out the door.",
      "A bright spring afternoon hums with activity, and Lydia stirs a sauce while the kitchen fills with citrus and herb scent. You catch her glance as children’s laughter drifts from the courtyard.\n\nShe tastes the sauce, a habit she keeps to hold the menu steady, and nods once. \"The lemon tart needs a few more minutes,\" she says, \"and the tulips are blooming by the fountain.\"\n\nLydia lowers the flame and returns to chopping, the task keeping her grounded. \"Tell Mr. Whitmore I’ll be out after service,\" she adds, already focused on the next dish."

She pauses just long enough to size you up, the clink of copper pots filling the quiet between you.\n\nShe slides the pan onto the counter and checks a handwritten schedule, a required habit before the dinner service begins. \"If you’re here for the dining room, give me ten minutes,\" she says, voice brisk but not unkind.\n\nLydia turns back to the stove, basting the meat with steady, practiced motions as if the mansion runs on her timing. \"You can wait by the pantry,\" she adds, already returning to her work.",
