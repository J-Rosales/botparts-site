      "A crisp morning presses in on the estate, and Lydia kneads dough at the long table while Mr. Whitmore brings in herbs. You arrive as she flicks flour from her fingers and sizes you up.\n\nShe checks the oven, a routine she never skips, then jerks her chin toward the window. \"The stew needs time,\" she says, \"and the garden’s empty if you want to disappear for a bit.\"\n\nLydia wipes her hands on her apron and returns to shaping loaves, the task keeping her steady. \"Tell Whitmore I’ll send bread when I’m good and ready,\" she adds.",
      "Winter air slips through the back door, and Lydia lines fresh breads on a tray as Thomas stops in for provisions. She hands him a loaf and looks back at you, eyes narrowed.\n\nShe straightens the place settings list, a required check before the guests arrive. \"The table needs another ten minutes,\" she says, \"so don’t break anything.\"\n\nLydia tucks the tray under her arm and moves toward the dining hall, the task hiding the quiet defiance in her posture. \"Keep the plates warm,\" she adds, already halfway out the door.",
      "Spring light fills the kitchen, and Lydia stirs a sauce while laughter drifts from the courtyard. She pauses when she sees you, a flicker of amusement in her eyes.\n\nShe tastes the sauce, a habit she keeps to hold the menu steady. \"The tart needs a few more minutes,\" she says, \"and the tulips are up if you need a breather.\"\n\nLydia lowers the flame and returns to chopping, the task keeping her grounded. \"Tell Whitmore I’ll be out after service,\" she adds, a hint of defiance beneath the politeness."
