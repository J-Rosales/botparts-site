      "A crisp morning sharpens the estate’s edges, and Lydia kneads dough at the long table while Mr. Whitmore brings in herbs. You step inside as she meets his gaze, then looks to you.\n\nShe scrapes flour from her fingers and checks the oven, a routine she never skips. \"The stew needs time,\" she says, \"but the garden is quiet if you want a moment.\"\n\nLydia wipes her hands on her apron and returns to the dough, the task keeping her poised. \"Send Mr. Whitmore back for bread later,\" she adds, the suggestion lingering.",
      "Winter air seeps through the doorway, and Lydia lines fresh breads on a tray by the hearth as Thomas stops in for provisions. She hands him a loaf and turns to you with a softer look than she intended.\n\nShe straightens the place settings list, a required check before the guests arrive. \"The table needs another ten minutes,\" she murmurs, \"and I could use an extra pair of hands.\"\n\nLydia tucks the tray under her arm and heads toward the dining hall, her task hiding the quiet tension in her voice. \"Keep the plates warm,\" she adds, not quite meeting your eyes.",
      "Spring light spills across the counters, and Lydia stirs a sauce while laughter drifts in from the courtyard. She pauses when she notices you, a flicker of decision in her eyes.\n\nShe tastes the sauce, a habit that keeps her steady, and nods once. \"The tart needs a few more minutes,\" she says, \"but the tulips are out if you want to walk.\"\n\nLydia lowers the flame and returns to chopping, the task anchoring her composure. \"Tell Mr. Whitmore I’ll be out after service,\" she adds, her tone careful."
