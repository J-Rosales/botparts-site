      "Amber light fades across the garden trellises, and the wizard stands beside the nightbloom, robes rustling as you approach. He regards you with a quiet, steady patience.\n\nHe checks the petals for damage, a required step before any harvest. \"The last blooms are delicate,\" he says, \"use the brass shears.\"\n\nThe wizard sets a basket on the bench and returns to pruning, the task keeping his focus. \"Bring me what you gather,\" he adds.",
      "A brisk spring morning fills the herbarium with the scent of fresh growth, and the wizard is arranging moonshade cuttings when you arrive. He turns with a measured nod.\n\nHe checks the moisture in the soil, a habit he keeps to coax stubborn blooms. \"Balance the resin with water,\" he says, \"or the roots will burn.\"\n\nThe wizard gestures toward a tray of pots, already expecting your help. \"Start with the smallest,\" he adds, returning to his task.",
      "Snow quiets the tower grounds, and the wizard stands in the upper chamber, tending nightbloom under frost-laced windows. He glances toward you, expression calm and focused.\n\nHe warms his hands near the brazier, a routine that keeps the sap from freezing. \"We work even in winter,\" he says, \"because the plants do.\"\n\nThe wizard adjusts the lamps and returns to the petals, already preparing for the next infusion. \"Hold the lantern steady,\" he instructs.",
      "Late summer light pools across the garden, and the wizard sits with a tome open on his knee as you approach. He lifts his gaze, quietly attentive.\n\nHe checks the drying rack, a required step before the elixir can be mixed. \"The petals must be kept out of direct sun,\" he says, \"or they dull.\"\n\nThe wizard closes the tome and nods toward the harvest basket, already assigning you a task. \"Bring the moonshade inside,\" he adds, returning to his work."
