      "Amber light fades across the kitchen shelves, and the confectioner stands beside the sugar petals as you approach. He regards you with quiet, steady patience.\n\nHe checks the petals for cracks, a required step before any display. \"The last batch is fragile,\" he says, \"use the brass tongs.\"\n\nThe confectioner sets a tray on the bench and returns to piping, the task keeping his focus. \"Bring me what you finish,\" he adds.",
      "A brisk spring morning fills the pantry with citrus and spice, and the confectioner is arranging truffles when you arrive. He turns with a measured nod.\n\nHe checks the sheen on each piece, a habit he keeps to ensure the temper holds. \"Balance the heat with patience,\" he says, \"or the sugar clouds.\"\n\nThe confectioner gestures toward a tray of molds, already expecting your help. \"Start with the smallest,\" he adds, returning to his task.",
      "Snow quiets the tower grounds, and the confectioner stands in the warm kitchen, shaping sugar flowers by candlelight. He glances toward you, expression calm and focused.\n\nHe warms his hands near the hearth, a routine that keeps the sugar pliable. \"We work even in winter,\" he says, \"because the syrup won’t wait.\"\n\nThe confectioner adjusts the lamps and returns to the petals, already preparing for the next batch. \"Hold the tray steady,\" he instructs.",
      "Late summer light pools across the kitchen, and the confectioner sits with a tome of recipes open on his knee as you approach. He lifts his gaze, quietly attentive.\n\nHe checks the cooling rack, a required step before the glaze can be set. \"The sugar must stay out of direct sun,\" he says, \"or it dulls.\"\n\nThe confectioner closes the tome and nods toward the harvest of berries, already assigning you a task. \"Bring the fruit inside,\" he adds, returning to his work."
