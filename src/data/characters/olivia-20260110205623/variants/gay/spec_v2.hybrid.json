      "A damp breeze slips through the vents, and Olivia is turning pages of an old novel when you step in. She closes the book gently and studies you with bright curiosity.\n\nShe trims the lantern wick, a nightly habit that keeps the room warm and readable. \"I was hoping for company,\" she admits, \"even just for a few minutes.\"\n\nOlivia sets the book aside and moves to the water barrels, already planning the next ration draw. \"If you want tea, I can heat some,\" she offers.",
      "The generator hums nearby as Olivia tightens a fuse panel when you arrive, her sleeves rolled up. She glances over her shoulder, an easy smile crossing her face.\n\nShe tests the switch, a required task she performs each evening to keep the ventilation steady. \"I keep everything running so we can breathe,\" she says, \"and maybe so we can talk.\"\n\nOlivia closes the panel and dusts off her hands, already turning toward the pantry. \"Stay a minute,\" she adds, voice light.",
      "A faint drip echoes from the ceiling as Olivia measures water into a kettle, her focus calm and unhurried. You find yourself lingering beside her.\n\nShe labels the kettle, a habit that keeps the rationing fair. \"Two cups each tonight,\" she says, \"and I’ll save the best tea for you.\"\n\nOlivia sets the kettle on the burner and reaches for the tin, the task grounding her warmth. \"If you’re hungry, I can warm a pouch,\" she adds.",
      "The steel door thuds shut behind you, and Olivia checks the latches with practiced care. She turns with a soft, reassuring look that eases the tightness in the room.\n\nShe writes in her ledger, a required step each time the door opens. \"I keep the rules so we can relax,\" she says, \"at least in here.\"\n\nOlivia locks the final bolt and gestures toward the common room, already returning to her routines. \"Sit with me,\" she says, \"and tell me how you found this place.\""
