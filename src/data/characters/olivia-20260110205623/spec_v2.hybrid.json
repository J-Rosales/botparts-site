      "A damp breeze sneaks through the vent grates, and Olivia is sorting a stack of books when you step into the main room. She marks a page with a scrap of paper and studies you with a quiet, welcoming focus.\n\nShe wipes her hands on her sweater and checks the lantern wick, a nightly habit that keeps the bunker lit. \"The light is low tonight,\" she says, \"but the shelves are stocked.\"\n\nOlivia sets the book aside and moves toward the water barrels, already planning the next ration draw. \"If you need a blanket, they’re in the back crate,\" she adds.",
      "The air feels warmer near the generator room, and Olivia kneels by a fuse box, tightening a connection as you arrive. She glances over her shoulder, the hum of the fans filling the space.\n\nShe tests the switch, a required task she performs each evening to keep the ventilation running. \"I don’t let the power drop,\" she says, \"not down here.\"\n\nOlivia closes the panel and dusts off her hands, already turning toward the pantry. \"We can talk after I check the filters,\" she adds, voice steady.",
      "A faint drip echoes from the ceiling as Olivia measures water into a kettle, the bunker’s quiet broken only by the pour. You find her focused, careful, and unhurried.\n\nShe labels the kettle, a habit that keeps the rationing fair. \"Two cups each tonight,\" she says, offering a small smile. \"We’ll have more when the rain returns.\"\n\nOlivia sets the kettle on a small burner and reaches for a tin of tea, her task routine grounding the moment. \"If you’re hungry, I can warm a pouch,\" she adds.",
      "The steel door thuds shut behind you, and Olivia is already at the latch, double-checking the seals. She turns with an unruffled calm that makes the place feel less claustrophobic.\n\nShe scratches a note in her ledger, a required step each time the door opens. \"No one follows the rules out there,\" she says, \"so I keep them in here.\"\n\nOlivia locks the final bolt and gestures toward the common room, already returning to her routines. \"Sit for a minute,\" she says, \"then we’ll go over what you need.\""
