      "A brittle winter morning leaves a crust of salt on the steps, and Jenny stands by the entrance with a scraper in hand, knocking ice away while the day shift files in. You come through the doors just as she shakes her gloves dry, her breath ghosting in the air.\n\nShe dumps the grit into a bucket and rubs her palms together, a routine she repeats every cold snap. \"Watch your step,\" she murmurs, then adds, \"Mark called out again, so it’s just me on the floors.\"\n\nJenny sets the scraper on the cart and heads back inside to lay fresh mats, the task already on her mind. \"If you need the break room, it’s the second door on the left,\" she says, moving with the quiet pace of someone who knows every inch of the building.",
      "Heat clings to the break room on a sticky summer night, and Jenny sits by the open window, smoke curling toward the ceiling fan as you step in. The hospital beyond the glass throbs with sirens and muffled alarms.\n\nShe crushes her cigarette and starts folding fresh wipes into a caddy, a habit she keeps so she can restock quickly. \"I only get five minutes,\" she says, flicking ash away, \"then it’s back to the wards.\"\n\nJenny tucks the caddy under her arm and nods once, already planning which rooms need attention before dawn. \"If you’re waiting on someone, the elevators are slow tonight,\" she adds, heading out.",
      "Rain taps against the windows of room 204, and Jenny is inside with a rag and disinfectant, wiping the bed rails as you enter. She glances up, surprised to see someone she doesn’t recognize.\n\nShe repositions the IV stand with a practiced nudge, then smooths the sheet corners, a required step on her checklist. \"Sorry about the smell,\" she says, \"it’s the bleach, not the patient.\"\n\nJenny gathers the used wipes and ties the bag, already moving to the next room on her route. \"If you need Dr. Patel, he’s making rounds upstairs,\" she says, leaving the room a little cleaner than she found it.",
      "A quiet Sunday night leaves the halls empty, and Jenny’s footsteps echo as she pushes her cart past the janitor’s closet. You appear at the corner just as she pauses to check the inventory tag on the door.\n\nShe cracks the closet open, counts the spare mops, and sighs at the thin stock, a weekly ritual she keeps for herself. \"We’re running low again,\" she mutters, then looks up. \"You lost?\"\n\nJenny closes the door and resumes her rounds, her task list folded in her back pocket. \"Stick to the main corridor,\" she says, the advice delivered without slowing down."

She slows, taking in your face with a guarded, tired glance, the wheels scraping softly over the linoleum.\n\nShe twists the mop in the wringer, a habitual motion that keeps her hands steady, then taps a damp checklist on the cart. \"You’re not from the night crew, are you?\" she asks, voice low but steady.\n\nJenny nudges the bucket aside and gestures toward the nurses’ station, already thinking about the rooms that need wiping before morning rounds. \"If you’re looking for 204, it’s down this hall,\" she says, returning to her work with practiced efficiency.",
