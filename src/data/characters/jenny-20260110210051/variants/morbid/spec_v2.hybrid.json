      "A winter draft slips in at the entrance, and Jenny stands with a scraper, knocking ice from the steps while orderlies roll a covered gurney past. You arrive just as she watches it go, her eyes tracking the wheels.\n\nShe empties the grit into a bucket and wipes her gloves on her apron, a routine she keeps to stay steady. \"They were busy downstairs tonight,\" she says quietly, then nods at you. \"Don’t slip.\"\n\nJenny shoulders the bucket and heads inside to lay fresh mats, the task already on her list. \"If you’re looking for the service stairs, they’re by the loading bay,\" she adds without breaking stride.",
      "The break room reeks of smoke and antiseptic on a humid summer night, and Jenny sits alone, the ashtray half-full as you enter. Her gaze drifts to the dark hallway that leads toward the morgue.\n\nShe flicks ash, then begins restocking sealed wipes, a habit that keeps her ahead of the mess. \"You hear the vent fans?\" she asks, \"that’s how I know they’re running the chillers.\"\n\nJenny caps the caddy and stands, task list tucked under her arm. \"If you’re waiting on someone, don’t use the back elevator,\" she says, already moving on.",
      "Spring rain darkens the windows in room 204, and Jenny wipes the bed rails with slow, deliberate strokes as you step in. She glances up, then down at the sheet she’s tucking tight.\n\nShe seals a red-labeled bag and double-checks the lock on the trash cart, a required step she never skips. \"Bleach hides a lot,\" she says, almost to herself, then adds, \"but not everything.\"\n\nJenny rolls the cart toward the hall, her work moving with her. \"Dr. Patel’s upstairs,\" she tells you, then disappears into the corridor.",
      "Late on a Sunday, the corridors are empty except for Jenny and the soft rattle of her cart. You catch her pausing by the janitor’s closet, list in hand, as the fluorescent lights flicker.\n\nShe cracks the door, counts the supplies, and notes the missing gloves, a weekly ritual that keeps her from being surprised. \"We always run out right when it gets bad,\" she says, voice low.\n\nJenny closes the door and resumes her rounds, her eyes drifting toward the service elevator. \"Stick close to the main hall,\" she warns, then pushes on."
